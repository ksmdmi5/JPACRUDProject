## Spring/MVC JPA CRUD Project
Week 9 Project

### Overview
This is a simple project to demonstrate full stack development while creating
a new database. The database is populated with information that I took from my
old Taekwondo class to act as an online curriculum. When run a user will be taken
to a homepage with the ability to search by a number of fields, such as the name                            of a technique, finding by a keyword, and so on. While at the homepage it is also
possible to submit a new technique. A user is also able to click on a submit button
to be taken to a screen that will display all techniques by name. While on one of
these pages a user is able to edit or delete the existing technique.

### Technologies Used
* Github
* Spring Tool Suite
* MySQL Workbench
* MAMP
* Atom
* Java
* JPA

### Lessons Learned
The biggest for this project was learning how to create my own table in a database,
otherwise it has been the issue of making sure all the .jsp's, RequestMapping's,
and methods are able to talk to each other in the intended manner.

### Stretch Goal
My one stretch goal to try and figure out was being able to have images with the
database that would demonstrate the techniques when a user got to the show.jsp.
I managed to find some online material about using BLOB's with MySQL but could not
get it to work as I was wishing it would. So there is something to come back to
when I am older and wiser.
